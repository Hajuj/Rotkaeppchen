# Rotkaeppchen
Little Red Riding Hood Game

This is a University homework (in German).

I created the world of Little Red, the game is still under development (JavaFX will be added soon).
For now you can run the code and see for yourself if Little Red makes it through the woods and deliver the food to her sickly grandmother (wine and cake) and yes wine helps;)

If you find any mistakes or find ways to improve the code don't hesitate to contact me (I'm still learning though).

P.S. the comments in the code are all in German (I'm too lazy to change it to English sorry).

# To Run The Code
Just run the MÃ¤rchen class (Maerchen.java)

Have fun! :D
